This is the miniboss of AES-ECB-CPA.
You don't get an easy way to build your codebook anymore: you must build it _in the prefix_.
If you pad your own prefixed data yourself, you can control entire blocks, and that's all you need!
Other than that, the attack remains the same.
Good luck!

**NOTE:**
Keep in mind that, unlike the previous levels, this level takes data in base64!

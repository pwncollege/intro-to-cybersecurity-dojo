This is the miniboss of AES-ECB-CPA.
You don't get an easy way to build your codebook anymore: you must build it _in the prefix_.
If you can change the length of your own prefixed data based on how much of the secret you know, you can control entire blocks, and that's all you need!
Other than that, the attack remains the same.
Good luck!

    There are many resources related to reverse engineering around the internet.

    - A good place to start is a series of walkthroughs of several hacking challenges by ASU's own Adam Doupe on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGt-0OOAFcM&list=PLK06XT3hFPziMAZj8QuoqC8iVaEbrlZWh).
    - A comprehensive reverse engineering [tutorial series](https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering).

    As mentioned in the slides, there are a number of useful tools for this assignment!
    Here is a (non-exhaustive) list:

    * `gdb` will let you run and inspect the state of these programs.
      Please check out the Debugging Refresher module.
      We have also provided a quick briefer here.
      Some useful gdb concepts:
       * Know the difference between `step instruction` (`si`) and `next instruction` (`ni`).
         It boils down to the fact that `si` will follow jumps, and `ni` will step over jumps.
         This means that if you use `si`, you will quickly find yourself crawling through libc code, which is insane and unnecessary.
       * You can use `x/i $rip` to disassemble the next instruction that will be executed.
         You can call `display/i $rip` to make the next instruction display every time gdb prompts you for input.
         You can also do `x/2i` and `display/2i` to print two (or other quantities of) instructions.
       * The `disas` command will disassemble the current function that you are looking at.
       * gdb can be scripted!
         Look up conditional breakpoints and scriptable breakpoints in the gdb manual.
       * Modern binaries are _position independent_, meaning that they can be loaded anywhere in memory when they run.
         GDB will load them at the offset `0x555555554000`.
         This means that if objdump is telling you that main starts at some address like, `0x100`, the address when debugging with GDB will be `0x555555554100`
    * `strings` will list printable strings in the file.
      This is useful for looking for constant strings that the program checks for (such as file names and so on) in the course of getting input.
      Keep in mind that the options for string include a minimum size that it will print.
    * Don't forget about pwntools! You will need to interact heavily with these programs. Do it right (with pwntools).
    * `rappel` is a nice tool to help you figure out what certain instructions do.
    * Tools for reverse engineering actual binaries, included in the dojo:
       * IDA is the industry standard of reverse-engineering tools.
       * Ghidra is an open source direct competitor to IDA that is used and loved by many.
       * Binary Ninja is an alternative product that competes with IDA in the space.
       * angr-management is an open source up-and-coming reversing tool with some advanced functionality.
       * In a pinch, `objdump -d -M intel the_binary` will disassemble the binary you want to look at.
         `-M intel`, in that command, makes objdump give you nice and readable Intel assembly syntax.

The web was designed to enable interconnectivity across sites. While this interconnectivity allows for conveniences like embedding images or linking to other sites, it also poses serious security risks. For example, malicious websites can cause victims' browsers to make sensitive requests on their behalf, such as sending a GET request to `http://challenge.localhost/publish`. Is that URL a picture of a cat which some other site would like to display, or a sensitive endpoint that should be carefully protected? Who knows!

This style of attack, known as **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, takes advantage of the fact that browsers may automatically make requests to other sites on behalf of the user. Worse yet, browsers may even include cookies and other authentication tokens in these requests, *automatically authenticating the attacker*. 

Modern web security practices include defenses against CSRF, such as:
- [**Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy): Controls interactions between different origins (e.g., `http://example.com` and `http://evil.com`); typically "writes" (e.g., form submissions) and "embedding" (e.g., `<img>`) is allowed, but "reads" are not. This means that you can send [simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests) to another site, but you cannot read the responses by default
- [**SameSite Cookie Attribute**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#controlling_third-party_cookies_with_samesite): Allows servers to specify when cookies should be sent with cross-site requests.
- [**CSRF Tokens**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/CSRF_prevention#anti-csrf_tokens): Unique tokens included in requests that attackers cannot forge, because SOP prevents them from reading the token.

Despite these defenses, they are not always implemented correctly. In this challenge, pwnpost has resolved its XSS issues for the admin user. Your task is to exploit CSRF to publish the flag post! The victim user will log into pwnpost (`http://challenge.localhost/`) and visit your malicious site (`http://hacker.localhost:1337`). You can easily serve your malicious site using a Python HTTP Server (e.g. `http.server`), or even using `nc` if you prefer. Since these sites have different Origins, be mindful of SOP limitations.
